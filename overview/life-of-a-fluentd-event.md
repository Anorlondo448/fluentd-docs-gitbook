# Life of a Fluentd event

The following article describe a global overview of how events are
processed by [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) using examples. It covers the
complete cycle including *Setup*, *Inputs*, *Filters*, *Matches* and
*Labels*.


## Basic Setup

The configuration files is the fundamental piece to connect all things
together, as it allows to define which *Inputs* or listeners
[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) will have and set up common matching rules
to route the *Event* data to a specific *Output*.

We will use the [in\_http](/plugins/input/http.md) and the [out\_stdout](/plugins/output/stdout.md)
plugins as examples to describe the events cycle. The following is a
basic definition on the configuration file to specify an *http* input,
for short: we will be listening for **HTTP Requests**:

``` {.CodeRay}
<source>
  @type http
  port 8888
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>
```

This definition specifies that a HTTP server will be listening on TCP
port 8888. Now let's define a *Matching* rule and a desired output that
will just print the data that arrived on each incoming request to
standard output:

``` {.CodeRay}
<match test.cycle>
  @type stdout
</match>
```

The *Match* directive sets a rule that matches each *Incoming* event
that arrives with a **Tag** equal to *test.cycle* will use the *Output*
plugin type called *stdout*. At this point we have an *Input* type, a
*Match* and an *Output*. Let's test the setup using *curl*:

``` {.CodeRay}
$ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 0
```

On the Fluentd server side the output should look
like this:

``` {.CodeRay}
$ bin/fluentd -c in_http.conf
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: reading config file path="in_http.conf"
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: starting fluentd-0.12.3
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: using configuration file: <ROOT>
  <source>
    @type http
    bind 0.0.0.0
    port 8888
  </source>
  <match test.cycle>
    @type stdout
  </match>
</ROOT>
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding match pattern="test.cycle" type="stdout"
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding source type="http"
2015-01-19 12:39:57 -0600 test.cycle: {"action":"login","user":2}
```

## Event structure

A Fluentd event consists of a tag, time and record.

-   tag: Where an event comes from. For message routing
-   time: When an event happens. Epoch time
-   record: Actual log content. JSON object

The input plugin is responsible for generating Fluentd events from
specified data sources.\
For example, `in_tail` generates events from text lines. If you have the
following line in apache logs:

``` {.CodeRay}
192.168.0.1 - - [28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 777
```

the following event is generated:

``` {.CodeRay}
tag: apache.access # set by configuration
time: 1362020400   # 28/Feb/2013:12:00:00 +0900
record: {"user":"-","method":"GET","code":200,"size":777,"host":"192.168.0.1","path":"/"}
```

## Processing Events

When a *Setup* is defined, the *Router Engine* already contains several
rules to apply for different input data. Internally an *Event* will pass
through a chain of procedures that may alter the *Events* cycle.

Now we will expand the previous basic example and add more steps in our
*Setup* to demonstrate how the *Events* cycle can be altered. We will do
this through the new *Filters* implementation.

### Filters

A *Filter* aims to behave like a rule to either accept or reject an
event. The following configuration adds a *Filter* definition:

``` {.CodeRay}
<source>
  @type http
  port 8888
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>

<filter test.cycle>
  @type grep
  exclude1 action logout
</filter>

<match test.cycle>
  @type stdout
</match>
```

As you can see, the new *Filter* definition added will be a mandatory
step before passing control to the *Match* section. The *Filter*
basically accepts or rejects the *Event* based on it *type* and the
defined rule. For our example we want to discard any user `logout`
action, we only care about the `login` action. The way this is
accomplished is by the *Filter* doing a `grep` that will exclude any
message where the `action` key has the string value "logout".

From a *Terminal*, run the following two `curl` commands (please note
that each one contains a different `action` value):

``` {.CodeRay}
$ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 0

$ curl -i -X POST -d 'json={"action":"logout","user":2}' http://localhost:8888/test.cycle
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 0
```

Now looking at the [Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) service output we can
see that only the event with `action` equal to "login" is matched. The
`logout` *Event* was discarded:

``` {.CodeRay}
$ bin/fluentd -c in_http.conf
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: reading config file path="in_http.conf"
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: starting fluentd-0.12.4
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: using configuration file: <ROOT>
<source>
  @type http
  bind 0.0.0.0
  port 8888
</source>
<filter test.cycle>
  @type grep
  exclude1 action logout
</filter>
<match test.cycle>
  @type stdout
</match>
</ROOT>
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding filter pattern="test.cycle" type="grep"
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding match pattern="test.cycle" type="stdout"
2015-01-19 12:37:41 -0600 [info]: adding source type="http"
2015-01-27 01:27:11 -0600 test.cycle: {"action":"login","user":2}
```

As you can see, the *Events* follow a *step-by-step cycle* where they
are processed in order from top to bottom. The new engine on
[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org) allows integrating as many *Filters* as
needed. Considering that the configuration file might grow and start
getting a bit complex, a new feature called *Labels* has been added that
aims to help manage this complexity.

### Labels

The *Labels* implementation aims to reduce configuration file complexity
and allows to define new *Routing* sections that do not follow the *top
to bottom* order, instead acting like linked references. Using the
previous example we will modify the setup as follows:

``` {.CodeRay}
<source>
  @type http
  bind 0.0.0.0
  port 8888
  @label @STAGING
</source>

<filter test.cycle>
  @type grep
  exclude1 action login
</filter>

<label @STAGING>
  <filter test.cycle>
    @type grep
    exclude1 action logout
  </filter>

  <match test.cycle>
    @type stdout
  </match>
</label>
```

This new configuration contains a `@label` key on the `source`
indicating that any further steps take place on the *STAGING* *Label*
section. Every *Event* reported on the *Source* is routed by the
*Routing* engine and continue processing on *STAGING*, skipping the old
filter definition.

### Buffers

In this example, we use `stdout` non-buffered output, but in production
buffered outputs are often necessary, e.g. `forward`, `mongodb`, `s3`
and etc. Buffered output plugins store received events into buffers and
are then written out to a destination after meeting flush conditions.
Using buffered output you don't see received events immediately, unlike
`stdout` non-buffered output.

Buffers are important for reliability and throughput. See
[Output](/plugins/output/README.md) and [Buffer](/plugins/buffer/README.md)
articles.

## Execution unit

This section describes the internal implementation.

Fluentd's events are processed on input plugin thread by default. For
example, if you have `in_tail -> filter_grep -> out_stdout` pipeline,
this pipeline is executed on in\_tail's thread. The important point is
`filter_grep` and `out_stdout` plugins don't have own thread for
processing.

For Buffered Output, output plugin has own threads for flushing buffer.
For example, if you have `in_tail -> filter_grep -> out_forward`
pipeline, this pipeline is executed on in\_tail's thread and
out\_forward's flush thread. in\_tail's thread processes events until
events are written into buffer. Buffer flush and its error handling is
the output responsibility. This de-couples the input/output and this
model has merits, separate responsibilities, easy error handling, good
performance.

## Conclusion

Once the events are reported by the [Fluentd](http://fluend.org) engine
on the *Source* they can be processed *step by step* or inside a
referenced *Label*, with any *Event* being filtered out at any moment.
The new *Routing* engine behavior aims to provide more flexibility and
simplifies the processing before events reach the *Output* plugin.
